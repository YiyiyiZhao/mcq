  {"response": "user Instruction: Task Requirements: You will receive a text string derived from OCR scanning of a receipt. Your task is to determine the total cost according to the text string. The floating-point number representing the cost may be found following the keyword \"total\" or its variants due to OCR errors. These variants may include \"TTOL\", \"totL\", among others. It is crucial not to alter the value; you must return the floating-point number exactly as it appears in the text string, excluding symbols like '$'.\n\nOutput Requirements: Return the floating-point number without any additional words, exactly as it is presented in the string..
